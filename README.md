# Who's the Ref? The Effects of Fact-Checking By Different Organizations on Voters' Perception of Election Integrity

This repository holds materials for Andrew J. Liang's proposal submission for the Replication+Novel Survey Experiments competition by Alex Coppock and Mary McGrath. 

The proposal replicates the following article: 

[Berlinski, Nicolas, Margaret Doyle, Andrew M. Guess, Gabrielle Levy, Benjamin Lyons, Jacob M. Montgomery, Brendan Nyhan, and Jason Reifler. 2023. "The Effects of Unsubstantiated Claims of Voter Fraud on Confidence in Elections." *Journal of Experimental Political Science* 10: 34-49.](https://doi.org/10.1017/XPS.2021.18) https://doi.org/10.1017/XPS.2021.18.

It then proposes to conduct a similar survey experiment for the 2026 midterm elections, using a "prebunking" strategy and treatments from state officials, mainstream media sources, and think-tanks. 

This respository is organized as follows:

- [`docs`](/docs/): Contains the proposals, replication, and reanalysis of the original paper. 

- [`data`](/data/): Contains the replication data for the original article, obtained from [Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/530JGJ).

- [`code`](/code/): Contains the code required to replicate the main results of the original article.
